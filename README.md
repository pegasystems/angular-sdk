## Previous releases

### Angular SDK - Release Announcement - v8.8.10 - June 2023

This version of the Angular SDK uses <strong>Angular 15 and Material 15</strong>, and <strong>only</strong> supports Pega Infinity&trade; 8.8.0 and higher versions. This is a <strong>significant update</strong> to the Angular SDK <strong>main</strong> branch. We strongly advise current SDK users to prepare for converting their changes to the SDK code to Angular 15.

***IMPORTANT:***  If you are upgrading from a previous version of Angular SDK, please follow the guidelines documented in [Upgrading Angular SDK](https://docs.pega.com/bundle/constellation-sdk/page/constellation-sdks/sdks/upgrading-angular-sdk.html).

# Overview of Angular SDK

The **Angular SDK** provides Pega customers with the ability to build DX components that connect Pegaâ€™s ConstellationJS Engine APIs to a design system other than Pega's Constellation design system.

The Angular SDK differs from out-of-the-box Constellation design system because it provides and demonstrates the use of a design system that is not the Pega **Constellation** design system. The alternative design system used in this Angular SDK is [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) - open-source components that integrate seamlessly with Angular.

The Angular SDK is built on a new and modernized UI technology stack (the Constellation JavaScript Engine and Constellation JavaScript API).

# Prerequisites

## Pega Infinity Server and Constellation architecture-enabled Application

This version of the Angular SDK assumes that you have access to a Pega Infinity server (**23.1.0+**) running an application that is configured to run using the Constellation UI service. _(If you need to use Infinity 8.8.x, please use the **release/8.8.10** branch instead of this **main** branch.)_

The **MediaCo** sample application is already configured as a Constellation architecture-based application and can be found in the Angular SDK download associated with this repo which is available in the [Angular SDK Pega Marketplace page](https://community.pega.com/marketplace/components/angular-sdk). The OAuth 2.0 Client Registration records associated with the **MediaCo** application are available in the same Angular SDK download. For more information about the MediaCo sample application, see [MediaCo sample application](https://docs.pega.com/bundle/constellation-sdk/page/constellation-sdks/sdks/mediaco-sample-application.html).

The **Angular SDK** has been tested with:

- node 18.12.1/18.13.0
- npm 8.19.2/8.19.3

Future updates to the SDK will support more recent LTS versions of node as the Constellation architecture supports them.

**Before** installing and running the SDK code, refer to the [Angular SDK Guide](https://community.pega.com/marketplace/component/angular-sdk) in the Pega Marketplace for the procedure to prepare your Infinity server and node environment so you can proceed with the steps in the next section.
