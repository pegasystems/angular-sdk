# Overview

The Angular SDK combined with Pega's client orchestration APIs (ConstellationJS APIs) provides a guided iterative development workflow experience. This accelerates integrating Pegaâ€™s Constellation DX API with an alternative (non-Pega) UI. Integrating an alternative design system is achieved using DX Components.

A DX component consists of the following:
- Component definition metadata that defines the low code developer configuration experience in App Studio and the parameters passed to the DX component for runtime rendering.
- Javascript to integrate component parameters, ConstellationJS client APIs, and alternate design system presentational components.
-	Storybook configuration and mocks for integrating with Infinity to facilitate local component testing before publication, configuration, and testing with the Infinity server.

The Angular SDK includes a ConstellationJS to Angular bridge and sample DX components. The alternative design system used in the Angular SDK is [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/). For more information about Constellation SDKs, see the [Constellation SDKs documentation](https://docs.pega.com/bundle/constellation-sdk/page/constellation-sdks/sdks/constellation-sdks.html).

# Prerequisites

## Pega Infinity Server and Constellation architecture-enabled Application

This version of the Angular SDK assumes that you have access to a Pega Infinity server (**24.2.0+**) running an application that is configured to run using the Constellation UI service. 

The **MediaCo** sample application is already configured as a Constellation architecture-based application and can be found in the Angular SDK download associated with this repo which is available in the [Angular SDK Pega Marketplace page](https://community.pega.com/marketplace/components/angular-sdk). The OAuth 2.0 Client Registration records associated with the **MediaCo** application are available in the same Angular SDK download. For more information about the MediaCo sample application, see [MediaCo sample application](https://docs.pega.com/bundle/constellation-sdk/page/constellation-sdks/sdks/mediaco-sample-application.html).

The **Angular SDK** has been tested with:

- node 20.16.0
- npm 10.8.1

Future updates to the SDK will support more recent LTS versions of node as the Constellation architecture supports them.

**Before** installing and running the SDK code, refer to the [Angular SDK Guide](https://community.pega.com/marketplace/component/angular-sdk) in the Pega Marketplace for the procedure to prepare your Infinity server and node environment so you can proceed with the steps in the next section.
