### About the SDK version naming: \<**SDK**>.\<**InfinityVersion**>.\<**SDK-release**>

**An example: SDK-A.87.0**
* **SDK-A** indicates that this is the Angular SDK. The Angular SDK provides an Angular-based bridge and associated components that connect to the ConstellationJS Engine. The SDK provides support for design systems based on Angular.
* **87** indicates that this version of the SDK is applicable to Pega Infinity version 87.*
* **0** indicates that this is the initial release of the SDK for Infinity 8.7. Even though this is the initial release, it _may_ still be applicable for Infinity 8.7.0, 8.7.1, etc. Check the SDK Marketplace page to find the SDK release that works with the Infinity point release you require.
